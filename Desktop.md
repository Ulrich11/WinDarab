# **Desktop**

While working with WinDarab a typical component constellation might look like this:

A Desktop consists of the opened dockable window and the worksheets you are currently processed. Each worksheet contains the worksheet controls whereby you analyze and visualize logged data.

WinDarab offers the possibility to save and retrieve a particular Desktop.

If loading a Desktop you can choose whether to view the files in a new Desktop or whether to restore a previous situation.

As opposed to simply loading a Desktop, restoring a previous Desktop constellation involves the closing of all currently opened files and the opening of those files that were in use as the Desktop was saved. In addition to the configured settings (e.g. channels) the windows will also restore the displayed excerpts and reproduce the situation exactly as it was before.

Every time you exit WinDarab the program saves the current Desktop and retrieves it the next time you start the program.

**Tip:**  
To suppress the automatic retrieval of the previous Desktop hold down the shift key when you start WinDarab

**Note:**  
During work WinDarab saves the current Desktop periodically.
